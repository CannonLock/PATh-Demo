<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">OSG Research Facilitation team presenting tutorial July 19 on "Empowering Research Computing at Your Organization Thorugh the OSG"</p>

We’d like to invite you to the PEARC21 tutorial on “Empowering Research Computing at Your Organization Through the OSG” taking place on Monday, July 19 (8am-     11am PT), presented by the OSG Research Facilitation team.

This year's virtual offering has been tuned for remote participation,
with the goal of helping attendees get their own work running within the 2-week period,
and is not merely a translation of the in-person program
(last offered in [2019](https://opensciencegrid.org/user-school-2019/)).

**The Virtual School will be held the weeks of August 2&ndash;6 and 9&ndash;13.**
The event is free and materials will be posted publicly.
A selective application process was required for full participation,
which includes access to HTC experts and to HTC systems via the
[Center for High Throughput Computing](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/approach.html) and
[OSG Connect](https://www.osgconnect.net/) service
(otherwise available to researchers working on a U.S.-based academic, government, or non-profit research project).

While no travel is involved and the schedule allows for some flexibility,
accepted applicants were asked to commit at least 20 hours each week.
You can view [the high-level schedule for 2021](https://opensciencegrid.org/virtual-school-2021/schedule/),
and we expect the detailed schedule and materials to be similar to the
[OSG Virtual School Pilot 2020](https://opensciencegrid.org/virtual-school-pilot-2020/).

We hope to return to an in-person OSG User School in 2022. 

**If you are thinking about applying for 2022**, ideal candidates will:

* Be graduate students doing research or support staff helping researchers (but see below)
* Need large amounts of computing, which could transform research or open new paths to discovery
* Have basic experience with the Linux command line (or learn beforehand)
* Be able to commit to at least 20 hours each week for the School dates

Not a graduate student or support staff?

We consider applications from advanced undergraduates,
especially those who are involved in graduate-level research or coursework.
Also, we consider people in other groups
(post-doctoral researchers, faculty, researchers, other staff, etc.),
especially if you convince us that this opportunity is likely
to have a significant effect on your work or research, or that of others.
