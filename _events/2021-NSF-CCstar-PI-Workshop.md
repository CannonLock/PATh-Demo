The 2021 Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) Workshop will be held September 14 - 15, 2021, 9:00am-12:00pm Pacific / 12:00 - 3:00pm Eastern.
    
The 2021 Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) Workshop builds upon the success of the previous CC* Workshops providing an opportunity for recipients of all active NSF CC* awards to engage with one another, exchange project findings, interact with national cyberinfrastructure experts and collaborate across project areas and project regions. Due to the on-going pandemic, the 2021 PI workshop will be conducted virtually.  


The advantage of conducting a virtual workshop is the flexibility of the virtual environment for broader participation of additional CC* award project collaborators such as co-PIs, researchers, and other campus representatives to participate in workshop conversations without the additional time demands and travel expenses for in-person participation.   Please encourage your project collaborators to register and join us for this meeting.  Feel free to share this registration link with them.
