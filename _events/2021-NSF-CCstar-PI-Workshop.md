The 2021 Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) Workshop will be held September 14 - 15, 2021, 9:00am-12:00pm Pacific / 12:00 - 3:00pm Eastern.
    
The 2021 Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) Workshop builds upon the success of the previous CC* Workshops providing an opportunity for recipients of all active NSF CC* awards to engage with one another, exchange project findings, interact with national cyberinfrastructure experts and collaborate across project areas and project regions. Due to the on-going pandemic, the 2021 PI workshop will be conducted virtually.  


The advantage of conducting a virtual workshop is the flexibility of the virtual environment for broader participation of additional CC* award project collaborators such as co-PIs, researchers, and other campus representatives to participate in workshop conversations without the additional time demands and travel expenses for in-person participation.   Please encourage your project collaborators to register and join us for this meeting.  Feel free to share this registration link with them.     
   
Attendance is free of charge, but requires registration (see below).
