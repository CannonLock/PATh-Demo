In March 2021, two David Swanson Award winners presented: John Li, a 2020 award recipient, who was unavailable to speak when the All Hands Meeting was rescheduled from March to September 2020 due to the pandemic, and this year's 2021 recipient, Nicholas Cooley.

John Li, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. attended the OSG User School in 2019 and quickly accelerated in his use of high throughput computing, whether running via a campus access point or on the Open Science Pool via an OSG Connect access point. John spoke about his work using data mining in genomics by high-throughput computing and noted that high-throughput computing saves significant computation time and projects that would have taken 2-3 years were completed in 1-2 weeks.

Nick Cooley, 2021 recipient of the David Swanson Award, attended the OSG User School in 2018. Since that time, Nick and his group at the University of Pittsburgh have undertaken a number of projects benefiting from dHTC and OSG capabilities, with more than 2 million hours of compute usage on the Open Science Pool in the last year. Nick discussed his work in computational biology on OSG.
