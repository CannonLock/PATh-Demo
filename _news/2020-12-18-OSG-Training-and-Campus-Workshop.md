This workshop is complementary to, and not redundant with our previous workshop in October. Apologies if you've received this message more than once via cross-posting.




Please feel free to send any questions about the event to events@opensciencegrid.org. If you’d like to discuss appropriate OSG services for your campus, let us know via support@opensciencegrid.org. We’re excited to work with you.



See you there!
