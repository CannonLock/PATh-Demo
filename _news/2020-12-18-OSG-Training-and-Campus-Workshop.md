MADISON — <a href="https://experts.news.wisc.edu/experts/david-o-connor" target="_blank">David O’Connor</a>, professor at the 
<a href="https://dho.pathology.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">UW School of Medicine and Public Health</a>, reports that recent advances in genetic sequencing of viruses
makes it possible to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout communities in Wisconsin. The raw sequencing data, however, needs to be extensively processed before
it can provide useful information about a person’s viral genetics.
