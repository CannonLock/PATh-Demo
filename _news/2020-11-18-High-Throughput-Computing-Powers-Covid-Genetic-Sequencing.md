MADISON — <a href="https://experts.news.wisc.edu/experts/david-o-connor" target="_blank">David O’Connor</a>, professor at the 
<a href="https://dho.pathology.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">UW School of Medicine and Public Health</a> reports that recent advances in genetic sequencing of viruses
makes it possible to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout communities in Wisconsin. The raw sequencing data, however, needs to be extensively processed before
it can provide useful information about a person’s viral genetics.

<a href="https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">The Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC)</a> powers this processing. In the last several 
months, more than 20,000 CHTC CPU hours have been used to convert electrical signals from a sequencing instrument into readable nucleotide letters 
that can be ordered to create an individual’s virus genome. More than 2,000 such genomes have been analyzed from Wisconsin since the start of the pandemic. 
As cases have surged this fall, the scalable computing resources of CHTC 
<a href="https://news.wisc.edu/tracking-virus-mutations-reveals-success-of-stay-at-home-orders/"
target="_blank">allow us</a> to generate sequencing data from key outbreaks much more quickly than if we were trying to process this data on computers in our 
lab alone.
