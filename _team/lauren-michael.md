Lauren began working as the first Research Computing Facilitator (RCF) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in January 2013, where she engages with researchers leveraging the CHTC’s large-scale computing resources and navigating the world of compute-related services and training. In her past research experiences, Lauren applied compute-intensive methods during the completion of B.S. degrees in Biology and Chemistry, as well as a M.S. in Biophysics. Alongside her research efforts, Lauren enjoyed a variety of teaching experiences, completed a graduate minor in Life Sciences Communication from UW-Madison, and gained formal experience in science communication as an editor and writer. In her current role, Lauren now directs the CHTC RCF group, which enables hundreds of new researchers to achieve compute-enabled research transformations, annually.
As a result of the documented success of the “facilitator” model, pioneered by Lauren and CHTC Directory Miron Livny, Lauren organizes a growing campus community of RCFs and leads the national network of Advanced CyberInfrastructure Research and Education Facilitators (ACI-REF). She also serves as the UW-Madison principle investigator on multiple projects around compute-driven research transformation and national communities of research computing professionals.
