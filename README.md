# Making Website Changes

This repository uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/path-cc/path-cc.github.io/tree/master/.github/worfklows)
to deploy a website preview from the `master` branch to the [web-preview repository](https://path-cc.io/web-preview/).
The production website (https://path-cc.io/) is built automatically by GitHub Pages from the `production` branch.

To make changes to the website, use the following workflow:

1.  Submit a pull request with website updates to the `master` branch (the default) and request a review
1.  Upon approval and merge of the pull request, changes can be previewed at https://path-cc.io/web-preview/
1.  If additional changes are necessary, repeat steps 1 and 2.
1.  When satisfied with the preview website, submit a
    [pull request](https://github.com/path-cc/path-cc.github.io/compare/production...master?expand=1)
    from `production` to `master`
1.  After the pull request from step 4 has been merged, verify the changes at https://path-cc.io
